# Home Lab & Proxmox Setup

This repository documents the setup and evolution of my personal home lab, which I use to learn about virtualization, system administration, and cybersecurity.

Currently running:
- Proxmox VE on a mini PC
- Jellyfin for media streaming
- [Planned] Nextcloud for personal cloud storage
- [Planned] Network monitoring & cybersecurity tools

More services and notes will be added over time as I expand the lab.
